# Calibration
This set of scripts is used for attempting to calibrate the Kinova and External Camera
system. There are two primary methods for calibrating the system:
1. Iterative Closest Points (Doesn't work yet.)
2. April Tag Localization (Custom)

# Purpose
Find the rigid body transformation between the external camera
and the base of the robot arm. With this transformation, we can
place the entire table in the same world frame.

# TODO
These scripts have been put into this folder by pulling data from a
variety of different sources. It is unclear which ones still work.

At some point, someone should check all of these scripts to see which ones work.
